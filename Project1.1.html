        <h3>Tweede-Tol</h3>
        <img class="home-images" src="images/camp-site3-crop_1.jpg">
        <p>Tweede Tol (second toll) is one of two tolls on the pass (the first is at the top of the pass just after the Bainskloof Trading post and is one of very few buildings to survive on The Neck of the pass).

          It was built in 1851 as the original tollgate on the pass and is also known as Wolwekloof (wolf's gorge). The campsite is kept small – only 20 standard sites (another six are privately screened off) with a maximum of six allowed on each site, so it isn't surprising that it can feel rather busy – particularly over long weekends and during school holidays when daily picnic visitors arrive in a fair number (up to 120 a day). </p>

        <img class="home-images" src="images/330e6c6e6fb969e1f2b7661d4caf4b0c.img.jpg">
        <p>Silvermine is probably the most popular climbing area on the Cape Peninsula with short walk-ins, good rock quality and many excellent routes. Silvermine has five different crags and over 80 routes with grades ranging from 13 to 28. The crags go into the shade in the early afternoon. The Lower Silvermine Crag has easy routes and is perfect for beginners, Blaze of Glory is a little harder, Silvermine Main Crag is a good all round crag and Fawlty Towers for some harder stuff. The most recent addition is Silverminor Crag.</p>

        <img class="home-images" src="images/leshauts.jpg">
        <p>Montagu is recognised as one of the most outstanding climbing destinations in South Africa due to the quality and number of climbing routes available. Montagu’s rock walls offer a wide variety of climbing opportunities at every level from beginner to expert.</p>

        <h3>Rocklands</h3>
        <img class="home-images" src="images/Rocklands2.jpg">
        <p>Rocklands is found in the Cederberg mountains 250km/3 hours north of Cape Town. It is a very beautiful area in a semi-desert setting, very isolated and very safe. Rocklands is undoubtedly famous for it's world class bouldering but this should not deter you from sampling the fine sport climbing. There is a large variety of quality climbing of all grades in both bouldering and sport climbing.</p>

        <p>The lovely seaside holiday village of Kei Mouth is situated 45 minutes drive from East London in South Africa's scenic Eastern Cape Wild Coast region. It is popular due to its location as the southern entry point to the Transkei Wild Coast and is also the starting point for the challenging Imana Wild Ride and the Wild Run series events, which are held annually.</p>

        <h3>Right Face Arrow Face Traverce</h3>
        <img class="home-images" src="images/right-face-arrow-traverse_scamble14-800x429.jpg">
        <p>This route starts at the same place as the Platteklip Gorge trail, but turns right onto the contour path, which you follow until you reach what you think might be Union Cave. Then you go up what you think is Yellowstone Gully, before realising it’s actually Union Ravine (because once again, Alison was doing a terrible job of leading from the back and the point where the path splits off to the right isn’t very clear), so then you have a big debate about whether to keep going up Union Ravine and decide that as much as it galls you, since you didn’t bring a map that shows where Union Ravine ends up, you should probably go all the way back down and then bundu bash across to Yellowstone Gully, where you can actually see four old ballies pointing (and probably laughing) at you from their privileged position on the correct path. From Yellowstone Gully, you meander up to what you think might be Andy’s Cave (where you fill your water bottles) making optimistic predictions that ‘very soon there will be some flat’ and hopeful promises that ‘it’s not all uphill’. Until you eventually reach the traverse and hear maniacal laughter echoing across the cliffs from ahead of you.</p>

        <h3>Tranquility Cracks</h3>
        <img class="home-images" src="images/1.jpg">
        <p>Tranquility Cracks refers directly to deep fissures in the rocks above Camps Bay through which one passes, about halfway along the Twelve Apostles. Beyond the cracks is a labyrinth of rocky corridors. There are a number of passages to choose from, all of which offer incredible views. Inside the cracks grow yellowwood trees that have earned the hike the alternative title of Yellowwood Cracks. Here you are sheltered from any wind and sun. Corridor Ravine is one of several paths that lead off the Pipe Track and is considered the easiest. It is the ravine after Slangolie (Slangolie is considered treacherous and not advisable to take), but has no marker of its own, so you need to keep your eyes peeled. The track up Corridor Ravine, which actually is more of a valley between Corridor buttress and Verreaux Crag, is steep with loose stones and some slippery sections, so it can take you about an hour to reach the top. Numerous breaks will afford you views over the Atlantic and across to Lion's Head.</p>

        <h3>Witels</h3>
        <img class="home-images" src="images/WC Witels 1 upper reaches.jpg">
        <p>Witels is a wonderful Kloofing trip between Worcester and Ceres. The best time of year to do this hike is between November and February. Winter is not recommended though if you like to ski then hiking up to Hoare Hut would be a must. This is a UCT owned hut so book in advance. Permits for Witels can be obtained, as well, from the UCT Mountain Club. It is not for the faint hearted or for those who don't like swimming, as swimming is compulsory at some points during the kloofing trip, so unless you have spiderman powers, and hate swimming, don't do this hike.</p>

        <h3>Alphen Trails</h3>
        <img class="home-images" src="images/1 (1).jpg">
        <p>The Alphen Trail is possibly one of the most popular of the green belt walks of the Constantia Valley. The walk can start at either end, but most people park their cars on the bend of Alphen Drive that leads off Constantia Main Road to the Alphen Hotel (a national monument in its own right with beautiful gardens and tea to die for, if you’re looking for somewhere to do ‘high tea’ before or after your walk).The trail winds along the Diep River to the Constantiaberg Mountain and in places allows one to walk on either side of the river, with a number of bridge crossings. It’s a beautiful walk filled with lush grass, trees, beautiful skies and the Le Sueur Meadow on the far end of the walk towards Hohenort.</p>
